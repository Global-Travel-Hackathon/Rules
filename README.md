# Rules
`Global Travel Hackathon Rules`

## :warning: Eligibility

* Attendees from all backgrounds, genders, and geographies are welcome. 
* Every member of the team must be 18 years or older on the day of the event

## :balloon: Team Formation

* The goal of the team-forming process is that everyone is in a team with a defined problem to solve.
* Teams can consist of at least two team members to a maximum of five members. 
* Make sure your team is well-rounded. A strong hackathon team typically has members with complementary skill sets — a few coders, someone who’s in charge of design, a project manager, etc. 
* Decide about the roles each of you will play on your team.
* If you don’t have a team: talk about your skill sets, share some of your past projects, and let people know what you could bring to the table.

## :pushpin: Prepping for pitches

To ensure that we generate good ideas and tackle worthy challenges, we want to provide the following questions in a template format:
* [Problem Name: …]
* [What problem do you want to solve?]
* [Why does it matter?]
* [Why is it challenging?]
* [Does it scale?]
* [Why are you excited about it?]
* [What do you need to make it happen? (who, skills, etc)]

The role that people in technical and non-technical roles could play – cross-team collaboration is the key.

## :point_right: I have a team, what’s next?

* Brainstorm how to tackle your idea and decide what each team member could bring to the project. 
* Narrow down the scope of your problems, propose solutions and begin to create a prototype. 
* Ask for help and feedback! This will help you to improve your work.  
* Don’t forget to check out the project development rules and the project submission. 
* Last, but not least - have fun! :smile: :tada: :100:

## :exclamation: Project Development

* No development may start before the actual date and time of the event. Any teams that violate this rule will be automatically disqualified.
* Any software development tools, game engine, IDE, and/or programming language can be used for the event.
* To ensure a level field for all contestants, all code must be created only at the hackathon. You are permitted to use publicly developed and openly licensed API’s and SDKs for your project.
* Assets, SDKs, APIs or other tools or components available under a trial license may be used.
* Any intellectual property developed during and within the scope of the hackathon must be open source and licensed under one of the licenses referenced in https://opensource.org/licenses. We will not have any rights and teams will be the author of their work. 
* The license selected by the team must be clearly listed in the README file of the project. The public code used inside your application should also list the licenses the code is subjected to.
* A team can use multiple licenses in the application. For example, the public code used could be licensed under the Apache license agreement whereas the code written by the team for the application licensed under the MIT license agreement.
* A team may not code applications that violate the [code of conduct](https://hack.travel/code-of-conduct/). For example, Racially insensitive ideas for an application will automatically be disqualified.

## :boom: Project Submission

All teams must create a repo on GitHub for their project and the README.md file _must_ include all these information:

- [X] Project name
- [X] All team members name (not obligatory)
- [X] Short abstract of the project
- [X] Hackathon topic you used
- [X] The development tools used to build the project
- [X] SDKs used in the project
- [X] APIs used in the project 
- [X] Any assets used in the project
- [X] Any libraries used in the project
- [X] Any components not created at the hackathon
- [X] Licence/s

To make it easier, we have created :point_right: this [repo](https://github.com/Global-Travel-Hackathon/GTH-Location-TeamName) for you. Feel free to fork and modify it. :tada:

:exclamation: `All projects should be submitted before [TIME], by sending an email to globalhack@kiwi.com with the subject [Team name]: [Project name] project for the Global Travel Hackathon and the body of the email must have the link of your project GH repo.` :exclamation:

Failure to submit will result in disqualification. You should commit regularly throughout the hackathon to the team repository, but if we see a single GitHub commit made near the end of the hackathon will draw the suspicion that the work was not completed at the hackathon.
